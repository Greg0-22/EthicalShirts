Start date: 5/23/2022

This is the the first -real- project using CSS and HTML to develop a sort of landing page. I will be creating a fake t shirt selling business website designed mostly from scratch using some design help from The Odin Project.

Day 1: left off at trying to break up the welcome text to make it more appealing and similar to the template. the commented out lines are the lines that i was working on but did not determine their efficiency yet

Day 2: finished sections 1 & 2. Some issues: font-weight can't be used because Roboto font needs to be imported. Font size is uncomfortably large, but following along with template. Day 3 will consist of me figuring out how to align the quote block section. I suspect my HTML is not written the best to achieve the desired outcome. Then, I will start on the section-4 and the footer, which should be easier now that I'm getting the hang of what does what. 

There have been 4 days in between days 1 and 2. 

Update Log: Properly aligned elements for sections 1 and 2 and changed their font attributes to match given template. adjusted margins and paddings to fill up screen properly. Unsure if zoom should affect the structure of the website. Designed button and borders for images using rounded edges.

REMEMBER: save to git more often. Many times I created an error and had to resolve the problem to get back to square one. Only one git commit this time.
