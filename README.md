Start date: 5/23/2022

This is the the first -real- project using CSS and HTML to develop a sort of landing page. I will be creating a fake t shirt selling business website designed mostly from scratch using some design help from The Odin Project.

Day 1: left off at trying to break up the welcome text to make it more appealing and similar to the template. the commented out lines are the lines that i was working on but did not determine their efficiency yet

Day 2: finished sections 1 & 2. Some issues: font-weight can't be used because Roboto font needs to be imported. Font size is uncomfortably large, but following along with template. Day 3 will consist of me figuring out how to align the quote block section. I suspect my HTML is not written the best to achieve the desired outcome. Then, I will start on the section-4 and the footer, which should be easier now that I'm getting the hang of what does what. 

There have been 4 days in between days 1 and 2. 

Update Log: Properly aligned elements for sections 1 and 2 and changed their font attributes to match given template. adjusted margins and paddings to fill up screen properly. Unsure if zoom should affect the structure of the website. Designed button and borders for images using rounded edges.

REMEMBER: save to git more often. Many times I created an error and had to resolve the problem to get back to square one. Only one git commit this time.

COMPLETION DATE: 5/28/2022

Day 3: Project seems to be completed. There are a few things that surely could be polished, such as the buttons, the quote section (section 3), importing the font to be able to adjust the font weights better. I also believe that the font size and font choice isn't the best, but it is true to the given template. I have not been able to figure out how to keep the elements the same as the page zooms in and out, but I don't believe that was taught before this lesson, so I will continue onwards to learn more!

Final Update log: aligned the quote section by changing margins and padding. Also changed the font sizes and weights. finished section 4. discovered that changing the margins on an element allows for that element intersect with another element. (reduced bottom margin on reward-subtext to align it with the sign up button).


PROJECT RECAP:

I learned a lot through this project. It was the very first time I did a programming project with absolutely no help minus sites like W3Schools and the like. Very minimal, if anything, was obtained from stackoverflow. I don't believe I understand flexbox the best yet, but I do understand how CSS works in tandem with HTML much better and I understand the importance of seeing the webpage as you're building it. The inspect feature is very beneficial and I've learned should be used to see exactly how elements are being laid out on the webpage. I would now like to learn how to build even more interesting webpages as this one is a bit flat and boring, but served as a fantastic introduction. I am proud to say I never gave up even when I was having difficulty, and I managed to preserve. So far, I still have a passion in this. Actually, it has grown.
