Start date: 5/23/2022

This is the the first -real- project using CSS and HTML to develop a sort of landing page. I will be creating a fake t shirt selling business website designed mostly from scratch using some design help from The Odin Project.

Day 1: left off at trying to break up the welcome text to make it more appealing and similar to the template. the commented out lines are the lines that i was working on but did not determine their efficiency yet
